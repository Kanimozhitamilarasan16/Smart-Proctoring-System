**Smart Proctoring System (Computer Vision)**

This project implements a Smart Proctoring System using Computer Vision techniques to monitor student behavior during online examinations.

The system focuses on real-time face monitoring to ensure exam integrity without using identity recognition, making it privacy-friendly and academically suitable.

This project fulfills the Computer Vision requirement for the PEP program.



**Project Objective**

To develop a real-time webcam-based proctoring system that:
- Detects student presence
- Identifies suspicious behavior
- Tracks face absence and multiple faces
- Displays professional on-screen alerts



**Key Features**

- Live webcam monitoring
- Single face detection
- No-face detection with absence warning
- Multiple face detection
- Face absence counter
- Persistent warning messages
- No face recognition (privacy-safe)
